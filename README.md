# **What is React** :question:

**The React. js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.**

**React allows developers to build reusable UI components, which can be used in multiple parts of an application. It uses a declarative approach to programming, which means that developers describe what they want the user interface to look like, and React takes care of updating the user interface when the data changes.**

**React is built on the concept of a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. When data changes, React updates the virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the actual DOM to reflect those changes, which can result in better performance compared to traditional web applications.**

**React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.**
