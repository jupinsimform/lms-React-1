# **What is React** :question:

**The React. js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.**

**React allows developers to build reusable UI components, which can be used in multiple parts of an application. It uses a declarative approach to programming, which means that developers describe what they want the user interface to look like, and React takes care of updating the user interface when the data changes.**

**React is built on the concept of a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. When data changes, React updates the virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the actual DOM to reflect those changes, which can result in better performance compared to traditional web applications.**

**React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.**

# React Setup From Scratch

### install Node.js and npm

---

```
npm install -g npm
```

---

## Step 1: initialize a project

Initialize project and generate `package.json` file with default values.

```
npm init -y
```

---

> **NOTE :** The -y flag stands for "yes", indicating that the user accepts all the default values.

---

## Step 2:install react and react-dom using below command

```
 npm install react react-dom
```

> 1. node_modules : The `node_modules folder` contains all the dependencies that your Node.js project requires, including their sub-dependencies and versions. It includes JavaScript libraries, executable files, and other files that your project may need. It's managed by npm and you generally don't need to modify its contents directly.
>
> 2. package-lock.json : The `package-lock.json` file is a JSON file that's automatically generated by npm when you run the `npm install` command. It contains a complete record of the exact versions of all the dependencies that your project requires, as well as their sub-dependencies and their respective versions.

## Step 3:install below loader,plugins and packages

```
npm i --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader css-loader style-loader file-loader html-webpack-plugin
```

> 1. `@babel/core` :This package is the core of the Babel compiler. It's responsible for parsing your JavaScript code and transforming it into a format that can be understood by different environments.
>
> 2. `@babel/preset-env` :This package is a preset that includes a set of plugins that allow you to use the latest JavaScript features while ensuring that your code is compatible with older browsers.
>
> 3. `@babel/preset-react` : This package is a preset that includes a set of plugins that allow you to use JSX syntax in your JavaScript code.
>
> 4. `babel-loader` : This package is a Webpack loader that allows you to use Babel with Webpack. It's responsible for compiling your JavaScript code using the Babel compiler when you build your project.
>
> 5. `css-loader` : CSS Loader being a front-end component is defined as an npm Module that collects all the CSS files referenced in the working application to help webpack and consolidate into a string. This compiles an application of a particular resource as a JavaScript module (CSS to JS file).
>
> 6. `style-loader` : style-loader takes CSS you've imported in your JavaScript files, and injects them as <style></style> tags into the DOM.
>
> 7. `file-loader` : Instructs webpack to emit the required object as file and to return its public URL.
>
> 8. `html-webpack-plugin` : The HtmlWebpackPlugin simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. This is especially useful for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation.

## Step 4 :create .babelrc file in our project root folder and config that file as below.

```
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

**After that** To use Webpack to bundle your JavaScript code and assets, and to serve your application locally during development you have to write belowed command

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

Webpack is a powerful tool for modern web development, and it can help you optimize your application's performance and reduce load times by bundling your code and assets in an efficient way.

## Step 5 : create a file named `webpack.config.js` and write belowed code into that file

```
const path = require("path");
const HTMLWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.jsx",
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "/dist"),
    filename: "bundle.[hash].js",
  },
  devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
    },
    port: 5000,
    open: true,
  },

  plugins: [
    new HTMLWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/index.html",
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".*", ".jsx", ".js", ".tsx", ".ts"],
  },
  performance: {
    hints: false,
    maxEntrypointSize: 512000,
    maxAssetSize: 512000,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(jsx|js)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: require.resolve("babel-loader"),
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.png|svg|jpg|gif$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "file-loader",
            options: {
              name: "[name].[ext]",
              outputPath: "assets/images/",
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};

```

> This code configures Webpack to build a JavaScript application in development mode, with an entry point at `./src/index.js`, an output file named `bundle.[hash].js` in the `./dist` directory, and support for processing JavaScript, CSS, and image files. The generated HTML file is based on the template at `./src/index.html`.
